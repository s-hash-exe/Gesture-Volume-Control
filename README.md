# Gesture-Volume-Control

Scripted in Python, this program controls the volume of a computer using gestures. 
It uses the opencv-python and mediapipe libraries to accomplish the task.

## Libraries
1. opencv-python: OpenCV is an open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.
2. mediapipe: Mediapipe is a cross-platform library developed by Google that provides amazing ready-to-use ML solutions for computer vision tasks. This project uses Mediapipe Hands.
MediaPipe Hands is a high-fidelity hand and finger tracking solution. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer 21 3D landmarks of a hand from just a single frame.
